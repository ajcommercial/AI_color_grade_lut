# AI_color_grade_lut
Creating color LUTs with artificial intelligence

This repository contains

- a modified version of the pix2pix version created by the Tensorflow authors so that the resulting models are smaller
- a notebook that takes an image and a tensorflow model and creates a color lookup table with it
- a Flask app with a Web based UI

A working version of the Flask app can be found here:  ec2-3-136-61-119.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
